# Medicaid Spending 

This is a project that analyzes data from 2016-2020 and predicts Medicaid spending based on the data.  

## Dataset 

The data is collected from the [Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet) website.

## Data Visualization and Analysis 

My analysis centered on a subset of the available data: 
<br>

**Brand Name**: The name of the drug filled. This includes both brand names (drugs that have a trademarked name) and generic names (drugs that do not have a trademarked name).
<br>

**Generic Name**: A term referring to the chemical ingredient of a drug rather than the trademarked brand name under which the drug is sold.
<br>

**Manufacturer Name**: Name of the manufacturer of the drug.
<br>

**Total Spending**: Aggregate drug spending for the Medicaid program during the specified benefit year.
<br>

**Total Dosage Units**: The sum of the dosage units of medication dispensed across the calendar year (e.g. number of tablets, grams, milliliters or other units). Unit refers to the drug unit in the lowest dispensable amount.
<br>

**Total Dosage Claims**: Number of prescription fills for each drug. Includes original prescriptions and refills.
<br>

**Total Spending Per Dosage Unit**: Medicaid drug spending divided by the number of dosage units, which is weighted by the proportion of total claims.
<br>

**Average Spending Per Claim**: Medicaid drug spending divided by the number of prescription fills.
<br>

### Top brand names 

In February of 2016, the FDA approved Harvani, a new drug used to treat Hepatitis C. Priced at over $1,100 per capsule ($1,127.76 to be exact), the average spending per claim totaled to a whopping $27,502.56. In contrast, in 2016, the median average spending per medicare claim was $77.26, and the median dosage unit cost was $2.22. The novelty of the drug, along with an aggressive and costly advertising campaign and high prices drove up profits for the drug manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, the top earner of Medicaid spending in 2016. 

<br>

Latuda, an antipsychotic used to treat schizoprenia, consistently ranked in the top ten sources of Medicaid spending and topped the list in 2019 and 2020. 

<br>

There were no other drugs that appeared in the top ten list all 5 years, but a two appeared 4 out of the 5 years: Lyrica, a nerve pain medication that can treat seizures and Humira Pen, an immunosuppressive drug used to treat arthritis that topped the list in 2017 and 2018. While Lyrica only costs $32 per unit, Humira Pen cost over $1,900 in 2016, and each claim averaged to about $4,500. The price increased over the years as well. 

 

### Top generic brands

Two medications share the same generic brand if they share the same active ingredients. 

### Top manufacturers 

From 2016-2018, Gilead Sciences was the top earner of Medicaid money, earning twice as much as the second contender in 2016 and 2017. By 2020, Gilead had dropped to fifth place. Since they specialize in antiviral drugs and Hepatitis C medication was the top source of Medicaid spending for 2016, this makes sense.
